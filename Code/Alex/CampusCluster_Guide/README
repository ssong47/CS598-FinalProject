Getting Code to work with Campus Cluster
_________________________________________


Use WinSCP to SSH into Campus Cluster: 
1) Transfer data into /home/$USER/scratch


Interactive Run:
1)make sure that Xming is installed and running on your computer
2)use putty.exe to ssh into cc-login.campuscluster.illinois.edu
3>srun --x11 --export=All --time=00:30:00 --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=24 --partition=csl --pty /bin/bash
4>Module load anaconda/2020-Jul/3
5>Python Part2NNet_thetaz_v36.py > output.txt

Run Batch Code:
1)use putty.exe to ssh into cc-login.campuscluster.illinois.edu
2>sbatch v36cnn.sbatch

Useful Commands:
>sinfo -a
>squeue -u $USER

**tips**
1. Setting --cpus-per-task to 12 (i.e --cpus-per-task=12) will make the queue wait time much faster
2. Although >module load anaconda/2020-Jul/3 might work for some computing tasks, it is much better practice use create an python environment for your project. That way, you can fully customize python
  1. To create a new python environment, first use >>module load anaconda/2020-Jul/3 on your workspace.
  2. Next, enter the following command in bash >python3 -m venv ProjectPure-env
  3. The new virtual environment should now show up on your workspace as a folder called "ProjectPure-env"
  4. Now, you can activate the python environment with the following command (assuming that you're in your user workspace)
   >source ProjectPure-env/bin/activate (note that you will need to add this command on your batch script before calling your python program)
  5. You can modify the installed packages using pip
